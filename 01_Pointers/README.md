# Pointers
* Pointer is used to points the address of the value stored anywhere in the computer memory. To obtain the value stored at the location is known as dereferencing the pointer.
* It is basically a variable that store address of other variables.

```
int a = 0;
int *a; // Pointer declaration in C language
p = &a; // Address of 'a' variable
printf("%d", *p) // Derefrencing. It will give the value of address location saved in 'p'
```
In similar way you can have pointers of different data types.
