# LinkedList

### Single linked list
* [Linked list in C](LinkedList.c)
* [Linled List in Java](Linkedlist.java)
### Double Linked List
* [Double Linked List](Linkedlist1.java)

**In Circular Linked list instead of placing null in the last node "next", we will point it to the head which is the first value.**

In this way the circular linked list is implemented.
There will be minor changes in all the functions of normal linked list.
